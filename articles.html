            <h1>Thoughts on the US Presidential Election as it Pertains to The state of Unrest in the World</h1>
            <p>It has often been said that WW3 will not be fought by traditional methods but would rather be “fought” via the internet, focusing on attacking critical infrastructure. (This is often misattributed to Einstein, but that is beside the point). When we look at current events in the world, it is becoming increasingly likely that we will indeed have time for at least one more world war.
Currently, the Russo-Ukrainian War is in full swing. Despite the constant stream of propaganda that Russia is suffering humiliating defeats, we see that some nations are choosing/openly considering affiliation with Russia rather than the United States/Ukraine. The list containing Hungary, Mexico, and Belorussia may only continue to grow.
In the Middle East, there is the very real possibility that Iran, Yemen, and/or Lebanon will declare war on Israel. Despite the religious hyperbole pertaining to the divine nature of Israel’s existence, we should not expect a miraculous repeat of the Yom Kippur War. It would seem that God has been rather faithful to the maxim “God helps them that help themselves”. Israel will be in a position where it is unable to help itself. Should war break out, Israel will fall without military intervention from the United States. Who else is there? Europe? Europe already teeters on the edge of civil unrest. No European nation will dare to help Israel for fear of angering their sizeable Muslim populations.
Europe has finally begun to awaken to the ramifications of their irresponsible immigration policies. Immigration was started in an attempt to address problems in the economy. However, it turns out that systematically replacing your native population with those who despise them may have harmful consequences. Given the recent rioting in the United Kingdom (a nation that refuses to riot for pretty much anything), I am confident that many European nations will experience civil unrest if not outright civil war of an especially distasteful kind.
For years, China has been demonstrating increasing aggression towards Taiwan. This in addition to their mischief in the South China Sea. It should be noted that a certain vice-presidential candidate has an unusual obsession with China and would perhaps go far in his accommodation of their territorial ambitions.
What is to hinder all these nations (and more) from openly pursuing objectives directly in opposition to the interests of the United States? Certainly not the United States itself, as it currently stands. Around the world, the common people and politicians alike look to United States and see weakness and indecision (hence why some nations are growing closer to Russia).
It is my view that opposition to the current administration is not enough to win the election. The Democrat presidential nominee has the potential to create distance between herself and the policies of her predecessor, at least in the mind of the electorate. It would be wise for Republicans to bind the Democrats to the current administration, because what other recommendation does their nominee really have. We might remember her extreme unpopularity, though the current Democrat voter would sooner forget it.
Sadly, there remains a lot to dislike about the Republican Party and its leader. The Republican Party seems to very good at reactionary indignation, but poor at formulating impactful policies. Indeed, a successful Republican policy seems to happen more by accident than by any serious forethought. Mr. DT is not eloquent. Eloquence can only come from planning ahead, constant improvisation is quite unforgivable. Through exposure, a Republican might know what he means in his long rambling speeches. Mr. DT seemingly never can say anything outright. An Independent and the non-ideological Democrat might be forgiven for being lost. We need short, snappy soundbites - not a tedious and tiresome tirade.
We are facing multiple conflicts around the world. We are facing the possibility that we may experience a third world war. At this juncture we should question who we want to lead the world at this time. Our choice is either someone who is all but guaranteed to continue the same disastrous policies or someone who may be better, but cannot really be much worse. It is my opinion that the safer bet would be to vote for DT. </p>
