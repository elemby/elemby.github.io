        <h1>Uilleann Pipes - A Quick Note</h1>
        <p>In this project I am making a half-set of uilleann pipes. A half set of uilleann pipes refers to a set of pipes containing: the tenor, baritone, and bass drones in addtion to the chanter. The addition of regulators make the set a complete/full set. There are plans to produce the regulators at a later time. The pipes are a Concert D set, slightly adapted from the Leo Rowsome plans available at <a href="https://pipers.ie/source/gallery?galleryId=922">Na Piobairi Uilleann</a>.</p>
        <h1>Wood Selection</h1>
        <p>African Blackwood has become the almost univeraslly preferred wood for the production of bagpipes. Possessing a Janka hardness rating of 16320 Newtons, African Blackwood is one of the hardest woods available. Unfortunately, African Blackwood is almost prohibitively expensive, if it available at all. For this project I elected instead to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peltogyne">purpleheart</a> (also known as amaranth), which is renowned for its beautiful purple color. With a Janka Hardness Rating of 11190 Newtons, purpleheart is softer than the preferred African Blackwood or Boxwood (traditionally used), but it is still harder than Ash, Maple (also traditionally used), or even Wenge.</p>
