        <button class="accordion">Brief History</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Northumbrian Pipes are significant in that they are the only form of the early bagpipe to survive in England following the massive influx of Anglo-Saxon settlers. Its survival is even more remarkable considering the turbulent history of Northumbria, which faced continued invasions by Norse vikings and Scottish raiders. It is perhaps Northumbria's proximity to the Scotand that might be credited with the survival of the Northumbrian piping tradition, as Scotland has what is perhaps the strongest piping tradition in the world. Though the Northumbrian bagpipes hav survived to the modern day, they are not a common instrument, and indeed face the possibility of becoming extinct entirely. The <a href="https://www.northumbrianpipers.org.uk/">Northumbrian Pipers' Society (NPS)</a> has been established to preserve the Northumbrian Smallpipes and its musical heritage.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Wood Selection</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Historically smallpipes may be made from any suitibly hard wood, often being fashioned from local maple trees. It must be noted that the softer the wood, the more "mellow" the resulting sound becomes. Unlike most other smallpipes, the Northumbrian pipes have a history of being made out of very hard materials. There are even some sets fashioned completely of ivory. However, the most popular choice for modern pipemaking is undoubtedly African Blackwood.</p>
            <p>My sourde for wood is <a href="https://www.bellforestproducts.com/">Bell Forest Products</a>. I have never recieved a bad piece of wood from them. I have additionally bought African Balckwood from Ebay vendors <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/turnerscircle">Turners' Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/exoticwoodzone">Exotic Wood Zone</a>.</p>
            <p>If you are attempting to make bagpipes for the first time, you should not attempt to make your first set in blackwood. It is inevitable that you will make mistakes. As a species, African Blackwood is not threatened nor endangered, but it is a subject of multiple conservation projects. It is responsible, (finincially and ecologically), to practice on cheaper, more abudant wood, such as poplar.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Plans</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The plans that I used for building the pipes are <i>based</i> on the plans of Robert Reid presented in Cocks and Bryans book The Northumbrian Bagpipes. It must be noted that the plans in this book are <b>not to scale</b> and are <b>missing important metrics</b>. Furthermore, bulding the pipes according to these plans would leave the pipes themselves very fragile, with the wood in some places being ~1mm thick. To address these issues, some modifications were made, particularly in the regions where brass covers the wood. These modifications were made using the plans from <a href="http://www.machineconcepts.co.uk/">Mike Nelson</a> to inform these decisions. Mike Nelson is a very accomplished pipemaker, even making pipes for Kathryn Tickell, (who is perhaps the most famous Northumbrian piper in modern times). However, there were some aspects of his plans that I disliked, particularly the multiple bore sizes, and strange bore sizes (eg 2.8mm and 3.2mm). For these reasons, I decided to make my own plans.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Step 1: Rounding Billets</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>African Blackwood typically comes in square billets. These should be turned to a perfect cylindrical billet before proceding. The process of rounding a billet can be streamlined as shown in the video:</p>

        <button class="accordion">Step 2: Rough Cut the Pipe Segments</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>We should rough cut the inidividual pipe segments to reduce machine wear. We especially do not want to overtax the expensive gun drill. The rough cut should be approximately 1/2" longer than the final size of the pipe segment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">Step 3: Boring with Gun Drill</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Boring the long straight holes needed for bagpipes without the use of a gun drill is essentially impossible. Twist drills are unruly and attempting to use for the purpose of primary boring will result in only three outcomes: 1) the bit deflects and exits the side of the workpiece or is so far off-center that the piece is useless, 2) the bit deflects multiple times leaving a eccentric, twisted bore, or 3) the bit overheats (regardless of coolant) and burns the wood.</p>
            <p>Gun drills are self guiding, and will not deflect. Since gun drills were intially designed for boring gun barrels made from steel, they can easily cut through hardwood. Gun drills have a hollow shaft, that allows coolant to be pumped to the tip, preventing overheating, and clearing chips away from the cutting head. Since we are cutting wood and not metal, we can use compressed air for this purpose. <b>It is essential to use compressed air in conjunction with the gun drill or you <u>WILL</u> destroy the drill</b>. In my experience 80-100psi worked very well.</p>
            <p><b>WEAR SAFETY GLASSES</b>. Wood chips are being shot out of the bore at about 1000 m/s, which <b>WILL</b> damage your eyes.</p>
            <p>A 1/8" countersunk center drill should be used for the pilot hole. </p>
